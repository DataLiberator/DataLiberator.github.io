                <br>

                <div class = "pull_quote">

            <br>
            This project uses <a href= "https://data.world/moma/collection"> MoMA collections data</a> to explore the acquisition habits of the museum, comparing its acquisition choices in 1937 to behaviors in 2017, eighty years later.
