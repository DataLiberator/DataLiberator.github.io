            <h1>Happy first day, Mom!</h1>
            <p>Let's shake things up with a new format today, in honor of this brave new digital frontier.

               <br></br>I'm really excited to hear about how your online class goes this semester! Even though it's not your preferred style of teaching, I know that you will approach this situation with your trademark style, hard work, and good humor.
                
               <br></br>You are in a great place this semester to help people in various places at the Marriott school. Your colleagues admire you and value your opinions and help (Adjunct Faculty of 2020, baby!), and your students will be grateful to have you steady at the helm during an unusual semester.
                
               <br></br>FaceTime me tonight, and let's catch up on your day! I will merrily do some tatting while you tell me what's going on in our lovely Deseret.
                
               <br></br>I love you so much, mother dearest. Good luck this semester! 
                
               <br></br>Love, Libby</p>
