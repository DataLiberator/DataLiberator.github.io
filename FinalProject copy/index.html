            <p> In 1929, The New York Times<a href="https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/10/releases/MOMA_1929-31_0010_1929-09-06.pdf"> announced the opening </a>of the city's new Museum of Modern Art, stating:
                <br>
                <br>

                <div class = "pull_quote">
                "Experience has shown that the best way of giving to modern art a fair presentation is to establish a gallery devoted frankly to the works of artists who most truly reflect the taste, feeling and tendencies of the day."
                </div>  
            <br>
            Has the MoMA achieved this goal? Do its acquisitions demonstrate a search for diverse and culturally representative art? This project uses <a href= "https://data.world/moma/collection"> MoMA collections data</a> to explore those questions, comparing the museum's acquisition choices in 1937 to behaviors in 2017, eighty years later.

            <p>In 1937, the MoMA acquired [X] items.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2017, it acquired [X] items.
                <br>
                <br>
                (That's an increase of X%.)

          <div class="step" data-step="2">
            <P>What artist nationalities are represented in each year's acquisitions?<br> <br>In 1937, the MoMA acquired pieces from artists of X different countries. In 2017, they acquired pieces from X different countries... an X% increase(?). <br> <br>The MoMA's collections are expanding to reflect a world that is becoming more interconnected.</P>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="3">
            <p>How about gender representation? Modern art is often collaborative, involving the talents of multiple artists. But how many of the acquired artworks involved at least one artist identifying as female?
              <br>
              <br> In 1937, X% of the acquisitions had at least one female artist.
              <br>
              <br> In 2017, women artists were still only represented in X% acquisitions. 
              Woahhhhh...
